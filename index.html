	  <h2>My Web Development Experience</h2>
	  <p>The only experience I have with creating websites is from the prerequisitie class ITMD 361. I enjoy both the creative and technical aspects of creating websites. I have created a few serious websites such as redesigns of premade websites or personal development webpages but also silly creative projects to explore new concepts. I know the basics of HTML and CSS but have not implemented the use of JavaScript or any programming languages into my websites.</p>
